The repository serves as a comprehensive resource for data structures implemented in modern C++, designed for a wide range of applications. Recognizing the fundamental role of data structures in computer science, this collection aims to provide efficient solutions for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data. It includes common structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, and graphs, along with more specialized ones like hash tables, tries, and segment trees.

Each data structure is organized in its own header file, offering a clear, user-friendly interface. The code has been rigorously tested to ensure both correctness and efficiency, combining handwritten test cases with performance benchmarks against existing implementations. Detailed documentation accompanies the library, explaining how to utilize each structure, its complexity, and any associated trade-offs.

Written in modern C++, the library adheres to best practices for readability, maintainability, and performance. By leveraging features like templates, type traits, and iterators, the code is made more generic and reusable, serving as both a learning resource and a practical tool for algorithm development in C++.
